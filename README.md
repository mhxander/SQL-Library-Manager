# SQL-Library-Manager
Creating an app using SQLite, Express, Pug, and Node.  This will create a book database for a library, allowing us to add, remove, and edit books from the database.


In order to run this app, you'll need to make sure you have "npm" installed.  Download the project files, and navigate to the project folder in your chosen Terminal.  Type "npm install" to install the correct dependencies, and then "npm start" to start the app.  Go to your chosen browser (this app was developed on Chrome), type "localhost:3000", and hit enter.  It should run from there.


I was able to use Guil's article project as a basis for this project.  Most of it was pretty intuitive from there.  I had to use the Sequelize docs and web searches to figure out how to add the pagination and search function.  Had a little help from the chat with finishing the search.
